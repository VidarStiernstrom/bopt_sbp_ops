Boundary-optimized summation-by-parts operators for first derivatives &amp; second derivatives with variable coefficients

This repository contains Matlab code for boundary-optimized summation-by-parts (SBP) operators for first derivatives, and second derivatives with variable coefficients. The boundary-optimized operators utilize stencils based on non-equispaced grid points close to the boundaries of the grid. This allows the operators to be more accurate compared to traditional central difference SBP operators.
